        "artistBio": "A report card for Robyn Rihanna Fenty, first issued by a school back in Barbados’ Saint Michael parish and later reprinted in a giant coffee-table book called <I>RIHANNA</I>, stated, in part, that the young Fenty was positive, sure of herself. She took a leading role in group activities. Most of all, she had ideas and seemed comfortable expressing them. Fast-forward to the present day and there remains something effortless about Rihanna, a sense of confidence that transcends any one narrative or style. Though her biggest tracks tend toward some variety of dance pop (mixed with reggae, EDM, dancehall, R&B, and so on), a closer listen reveals an artist willing to try just about anything—and the uncanny grace to sound good doing it. Describing the chameleonic nature of her clothing line, Fenty—the first female-created brand for LVMH, not to mention its first luxury label run by a black woman—Rihanna said the line didn’t have any fixed look, in part because her own was always changing. She was making things up as she went along, but when she went, she went full-steam ahead.<br>\nBorn in Barbados in 1988, she left high school to pursue music. Her 2005 debut, <I>Music of the Sun</I>, went Gold when she was just 17. By 2007’s <I>Good Girl Gone Bad</I>, she’d expanded the sunny Caribbean pop of her early work for sleek hybrids of hip-hop, R&B, club music, and rock. Her tracks are inescapable—“Umbrella,” “Don’t Stop the Music,” “Rude Boy,” “Work”—but also have genuine personality, not to mention a carnal sense of expressiveness that sets her apart: Rihanna’s changes don’t seem like the product of high-concept self-reinvention so much as gut feeling. After leaving Def Jam in 2014 for a spot with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, she took greater creative control for 2016’s <I>ANTI</I>, her most diverse album yet."

                  "standard": "Rihanna spent the first decade of her career uniting pop, rap, R&B, and EDM audiences under her ever-expanding umbrella-ella-ella. But on her eighth album, 2016’s <i>ANTI</i>, Rihanna quit making music for the masses and started making music for herself. Though hardly the wanton act of commercial suicide its title might suggest, <i>ANTI</i> nonetheless presents a stark, intimate portrait of RiRi in the raw. Beats twitch and clang where they used to thump, minimalist incantations replace the soaring choruses of old, pop polish gives way to jagged edges, Calvin Harris collabs take a backseat to Tame Impala covers. With its gritty industrial-soot patina and lo-fi patchwork quality, the album is much closer in spirit to the insular indie R&B of left-field mavericks like Solange and Blood Orange than to anything pumping out of the Coachella dance tent.<br /> \nBut by stripping down the production, <i>ANTI</i> brings Rihanna’s most magnetic qualities to the fore, as she infuses the woozy, fever-dream boudoir soul of “Kiss It Better” with the righteous indignation of a woman scorned, while investing the sacred gospel sway of “Love on the Brain” with profane, unfiltered expressions of romantic longing. And on her rendition of Tame Impala’s “New Person, Same OId Mistakes”—essentially a new vocal recording atop the same backing track, rebranded as “Same Ol’ Mistakes”—she drowns herself in Kevin Parker’s psychedelic stew as if self-adminteristing a baptism, reframing the original’s sad-eyed ennui as ecstatic rebirth. Yet even a deliberately transgressive Rihanna record couldn’t help but find its way to the top of the charts: Her dancehall dalliance with Drake on “Work” yielded one of the decade’s most incessant earworms, while providing a ready-made mission statement for an artist intent on maintaining her rarefied pop-icon stature entirely on her own terms.",

                  "standard": "For the musical companion to <i>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</i>, readmission to Marvel’s African kingdom comes with the same magical elements of wonder and revelation found the first time around. This is perhaps in part down to the return of Ludwig Göransson—who composed the score for <i>Wakanda Forever</i> and its 2018 predecessor—who co-helms (alongside Archie Davis, Dave Jordan, and director Ryan Coogler) this new, brilliantly diverse run of original tracks. “For this movie and soundtrack especially, Ryan and I wanted to create a soundworld that's incredibly immersive, where you can't tell the difference from song and score,” Ludwig Göransson tells Apple Music. “So the only way to achieve that was for me to do both at the same time. So while I was recording musicians in the daytime in Mexico for the score, at night I was using those score elements and those recordings done earlier in the day, booking sessions in Mexico with contemporary artists, rappers, and singers.” \n\nA touching rendition of Bob Marley’s “No Woman, No Cry” from Nigerian singer Tems was the world’s first taste of the movie’s music, via a trailer at San Diego Comic-Con 2022, and helped prep us for the mournful tone of the sequel. Just as the world stopped to grieve the passing of actor Chadwick Boseman, so do the five tribes of Wakanda mark the death of the eponymous superhero. Marking this occasion with solo music for the first time in six years, Rihanna sings the Tems-penned elegy “Lift Me Up.” \"As soon as I read the script and started thinking about artists to work with, she was probably the first name on the list,” Göransson says. “Because this story is so much about powerful women and motherhood.”\n\nAfrica itself is also, of course, central to the soundtrack. Traditional flutes and drums combine for thrillingly fluid sections (Fireboy DML’s “Coming Back for You”), and the sweeping head rush of amapiano also appears on “Love & Loyalty” (by DBN Gogo, Sino Msolo, Kamo Mphela, Young Stunna, and Busiswa), recorded in Lagos, West Africa’s central music hub. Felt in the double-time rhymes of Rema and Alemán (“Pantera”) and an ethereal coming-together of newcomers CKay and PinkPantheress (“Anya Mmiri”) is the resilience of African and Mesoamerican cultures—glistening with tradition but thriving through bright reinvention. \n\n“It was really tough [at first] because we had a sound with themes and instruments from the first movie that I couldn't use again and all of those themes has so much meaning to it,” Göransson says. “So I think that was the most exciting part when we worked on this movie, was to create a completely unique, immersive sound experience where all the sound, all the music, all the songs, all the words, everything was written specifically. It's Mayan, it's Aztec, it's synthesizers, it's <i>songs</i>, it's regional Mexican songs, it's Afropop, it's rap. It's the whole plate!”\n",

                "artistBio": "Although Britney Spears’ career is often viewed through the lens of major ’80s teen-pop luminaries such as Debbie Gibson or Madonna, the vocalist outgrew her prefab, mall-music image and became one of the 21st century’s most adventurous pop stars. Spears’ initial performing experience came on TV, as a cast member on a ’90s reboot of <I>The Mickey Mouse Club</I>. After her time on that show ended, the Kentwood, LA-raised artist became a pillar of the nascent Y2K teen-pop boom: Her 1999 debut, <I>...Baby One More Time</I>, was certified diamond (10 times platinum) in less than a year, and the next year’s <I>Oops!...I Did It Again</I> shipped 9 million copies by mid-2001. Multiple dance-geared hits followed, courtesy of collaborations with sonic icons—Swedish pop guru Max Martin (“...Baby One More Time”), adventurous production team The Neptunes (“I’m a Slave 4 U”), and electro mavens Bloodshy and Avant (“Toxic”). Sales aside, however, Spears became one of the biggest pop stars ever due to the savvy way she expresses the complicated calculus of being a woman in the modern world. Her lyrics tackle massive fame, romantic drama, and the challenge of maintaining a sense of self—all of which translates to an emotionally vulnerable persona that finds Spears asserting she’s a survivor (“Stronger”), sexually empowered (woe to the cheater depicted in “Womanizer”), and not a pushover."

                "artistBio": "With a style that perfectly bridges hip-hop's boisterous side to R&B's organic fluidity, Ciara instantly became, and remains, the First Lady of Crunk&B. Ciara Princess Harris, born in 1985 in Austin, Texas, was raised in Atlanta, Georgia, and given her nickname by none other than local Dirty South deity Lil Jon. The tastemaking producer laced her 2004 debut single, “Goodies,” with elastic 808s and sparse, synthesized instrumentation, but it was the singer’s hushed coo and reedy falsetto that rang out. The subsequent <I>Goodies</I> album, and coolly booming songs like “One, Two Step” saw Ciara pushing the smooth sounds shaped by superstars like Usher to new energetic heights. Meanwhile, her collaborations cemented her status as a go-to for all things vibrant—she even manages to up the electricity on a Missy Elliott single, “Lose Control,” with her swaggering half-rapped, half-sung cameo. As seen throughout her career, it’s as if Ciara can flip a switch between vivacious and velvety vocals. With her second album, 2006’s <I>Ciara: The Evolution</I>, she used that gift to explore her sensuality through ballads like the Prince-inspired “Promise.” In 2013, she continued in that vein with “Body Party,” a lavish Future-assisted love song that connected past to present by interpolating Ghost Town DJs’ “My Boo.” As R&B has evolved, so too has Ciara. Instead of sticking to a script, she’s dabbled freely in varied sounds, incorporating Tiwa Savage-inspired Afrobeats in “Freak Me,” and dynamic footwork-style production into “Level Up,” both singles from 2019’s <I>Beauty Marks</I>. Each song feels like a revolutionized take on the unique sonic mashup that Ciara helped launch, and plays like an ode to her continued growth. Since 2020, she's hosted <i>Level Up Radio</i> on Apple Music Hits."

                "artistBio": "Few artists have impacted 21st century rap like Nicki Minaj. Born Onika Tanya Maraj in Trinidad and Tobago in 1982 but raised mostly in Queens, Minaj attended Manhattan’s prestigious LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts (the inspiration for the movie <i>Fame</i>) before trying to make it as an actor— a past evidenced by the deep performative streak that runs through her music today. Turning to rap in her twenties, Minaj quickly became one of the brightest stars in Lil’ Wayne’s Young Money universe. Her work—shapeshifting, ferocious, cartoonish, and often filled with oddball voices and alter egos—is as capable of breaking hearts (“Super Bass”) as it is detaching heads (her breakout verse on Kanye West’s 2010 “Monster,” in which she arguably outshined both West and fellow guest Jay-Z). Minaj’s electrifying presence has also made her a secret weapon in the pop world, where she's just as likely to share credits with David Guetta and Justin Bieber as Ludacris and Future. On top of her own success, Minaj helped rap—and rap audiences—look past narratives of gritty realism for something fluid and playful, but no less genuine or powerful. Railing against the double standard faced by women in entertainment, the outspoken Minaj once told MTV, “You have to be a beast. That’s the only way they respect you.”"

                "artistBio": "She’s the dream girl. The free spirit. The candy-coated pinup and the well of inner strength. She’s a little Disney, a little Betty Boop. But she’s also an avatar for the modern female pop star in a post-Madonna world—the liberated woman who kicks open doors without knocking. Under all the sparkle and glitter, you could sense an artist grappling with messy human contradictions—about sexuality, about self-love, about asserting femininity in a man’s world. Talking to Apple Music in 2019, Katy Perry said she leads with her gut and lets her mind follow, and doesn’t make much sense of any of it until the work is done. “The themes are joy,” she said. “They are empowerment. They are trying to expand the boundaries of what I think, and trying to learn from all this opportunity.” She might actually be a superhero. But she also might just be what she is: a girl from Southern California who worked like crazy and didn’t flinch.<br>\nBorn in 1984 to Pentecostal pastors in Santa Barbara, Perry (originally Katy Hudson) grew up on gospel music, putting out her first album, 2001’s <I>Katy Hudson</I>, on a Christian label. At some point during adolescence, she discovered Queen, a band whose mix of flamboyance, power, and sexualized wit cracked her creative world open. (Perry named her fragrance Killer Queen, after one of the band’s signature songs.) Club tracks, ballads, classic pop-rock, and contemporary electronic music—Perry’s production collaborators are brilliant (Dr. Luke, Max Martin, benny blanco), but it's her songwriting, her image, her balance of playfulness and confidence that pull the package together. And for every “Teenage Dream” or “I Kissed a Girl,” there's a “Firework” or a “Roar,” music that turns expressions of vulnerability into anthems of inclusion and self-renewal—a dynamic that has made Perry an inspirational figure not only to young women, but for an LGBTQ community she vocally supports.<br>\nPerry doesn’t quite know how she went so platinum—2010’s <I>Teenage Dream</I> reached commercial heights previously set only by Michael Jackson—but while the numbers are nice, the work is what's important. “It’s up to me to make the right choice in my mind to keep putting one foot in front of the other and going forward,” Perry told Apple Music. “Not going backwards—I could easily go backwards by literally looking at a photo. But I have to go forward, because I know what’s good for me now.”"

                "artistBio": "Jennifer Lopez’s canny ability to bring the Nuyorican soundtrack of her upbringing to the global stage has defined her career. It was never more apparent than in 2020's Superbowl LIV halftime performance, where she celebrated Boricua pride in a thrilling, rhythm-heavy extravaganza. Blending uptown brass with brown-eyed soul and R&B, the multi-hyphenate artist brings her Latin freestyle edge to pop and hip-hop, always staying on the vanguard through savvy collaborations with French Montana, DJ Khaled, and Cardi B. Born in The Bronx in 1969, Jennifer Lynn Lopez started out in musical theater as a child before she made waves as a Fly Girl dancer on <I>In Living Color</I> and then as an actress on the silver screen. Just after rising to fame with her acclaimed role as the late Tejano queen Selena, Lopez released her first single, 1999’s dance-pop banger “If You Had My Love.” Lopez welcomed funkier grooves and declared her hometown pride with 2002’s “Jenny from the Block.” She displayed her biculturalism and more romantic side on albums like 2007’s <I>Como Ama una Mujer</I>, but she proved she could still amp up the party when she teamed up with Pitbull for the EDM-heavy “On the Floor.” Over the decades, the performer has continued to embrace her lively funk sensibility, as evidenced by 2019’s “Medicine” single. “You gravitate to what you know, to what feels comfortable and what feels good [...] That funk, those instruments, that’s what makes me move,” Lopez told Apple Music. “That percussion and brass live inside my blood. That’s what I grew up with, and that’s who I am at my core. It’s always going to be an influence.”"

                "artistBio": "Some may dismiss pop as inauthentic. But for Lady Gaga—one of popular culture’s greatest, most extravagant creations—the inauthenticity is the point. No artist has more defiantly embodied that provocation this century than the one born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta (in New York in 1986). Never wedded to the same image—one minute wearing a dress made of raw meat at the MTV VMAs, the next a coat of Kermit the Frog puppets on German TV—Gaga personifies pop’s surface obsessions while simultaneously upending them.<br>\nIn a sense, her creative identity had crystallized by age 21, having been a child pianist, aspiring actor, and burlesque performer. Each of these facets powered her career’s most distinct parts: the celebrity fascination of her first two albums, 2008’s <i>The Fame</i> and 2009’s <i>The Fame Monster</i>; the subversive layering of 2011’s <i>Born This Way</i> and 2013’s <i>ARTPOP</i>; the sincere reverence of 2014’s <i>Cheek to Cheek</i>, her jazz standards album with Tony Bennett; and the rootsier songwriting of 2016’s <i>Joanne</i>. If 2009’s “Paparazzi” reveled in the flashes, then “Born This Way” celebrated inner light: In translating her diffuse identity into world-conquering art, Gaga has become a beacon to anyone else who’s felt like an outsider. Her loyal following—a.k.a. Little Monsters—has affirmed a deep connection to her message of self-love and self-expression, despite pop’s fickleness and her chameleonic exterior. She played out a simpler version of her path to fame in the 2018 remake of <i>A Star Is Born</i>: But while her character’s ascent was abetted by her lover, Gaga’s was all her own."

                "artistBio": "Singer Kelly Rowland has followed a path that’s been undeniably blessed: As a founding member of the biggest R&B girl group of the early 2000s, Destiny’s Child, she had none other than Beyoncé Knowles as a best friend and musical partner. And while it must be hard to share a spotlight with the cultural supernova that is Beyoncé, Rowland has managed to carve out a meaningful, successful solo career for herself. Born Kelendria Trene Rowland in Atlanta, GA, in 1981, she had her star hitched to Destiny’s Child from the group’s 1997 debut until their disbanding in 2005. Rowland released her first solo album, <I>Skin Deep</I>, in 2002 and scored a massive hit single with the rapper Nelly that same year on the slow jam “Dilemma.” But it was her second release, 2007’s <I>Ms. Kelly</I>, that established her sassy Houston sound with the bouncing R&B single “Like This.” The fingerprints of Destiny’s Child are all over that release, but she stretched her boundaries on 2011’s <I>Here I Am</I>, which featured the steamy duet “Motivation” with Lil Wayne, and 2013’s <I>Talk a Good Game</I>. After a recording hiatus, Rowland reappeared with a string of forward-thinking singles, starting in 2018 with the fierce “Kelly.” In 2020, she contributed to the soundtrack for the satirical comedy horror flick <I>Bad Hair</I> (and appeared in it), while also releasing excellent singles like the Afrobeat-tinged “Hitman” and the pop-trap stunner “Coffee.”"

                "artistBio": "Christina Aguilera boasts a fierce four-octave vocal range, but it’s hardly the only thing that’s kept the superstar a dominant force in pop’s ever-changing landscape. The petite powerhouse, born on Staten Island on December 18, 1980, quickly rose from the <I>Star Search</I> stage to <I>The Mickey Mouse Club</I> to MTV with a high-flying, melismatic soprano and plenty of sass. Her 1999 self-titled debut album proved she could tease and tantalize with as much untouchable charm as fellow former Mouseketeer, Britney Spears, when “Genie in a Bottle,” “What a Girl Wants,” and “Come on Over Baby (All I Want Is You)” all hit No. 1 on the pop charts. Since then, she’s stayed steadfastly in the spotlight—not just by meticulously reinventing her image, but also by organically revealing more and more of herself, letting us peek into her own journey of self-discovery while remaining an inimitable artist. In the process, she’s liberated herself more than once, starting with her metamorphosis into Xtina for 2002’s saucy R&B- and hip-hop-infused <I>Stripped</I> and its raunchy lead single “Dirrty (feat. Redman),” all the way to 2018’s genre-hopping <I>Liberation</I> and its feminist anthem “Fall In Line,” co-starring Demi Lovato. In between, she’s growled through brassy funk (“Ain’t No Other Man”) and heart-pumping electro-pop (“Not Myself Tonight”), trilled over intimate piano balladry (“Hurt”) and sizzling R&B (“Like I Do”), and collaborated with a wide spectrum of artists, songwriters, and producers, including Linda Perry, Lil’ Kim, A Great Big World, Maroon 5, Sia, Kanye West, Blake Shelton, and <I>Burlesque</I> co-star Cher. Through it all, Aguilera has used the power of her voice to empower listeners—to stand strong (“Fighter”), embrace their true essence (“Change”), and, ultimately, love themselves just a little bit more (“Beautiful”)."

                "artistBio": "When Stacy Ann Ferguson joined the critically acclaimed but commercially underperforming rap trio Black Eyed Peas in 2003, she was still the second most famous Fergie in the world. But while she had yet to overtake the Duchess of York in online search results, the singer was no rookie, either. Born in 1975, the Los Angeles native already had nearly two decades of showbiz experience under her belt, first as a child actor and then as a member of ’90s R&B hopefuls Wild Orchid. Her passionate presence not only pushed the Peas out of the conscious-hip-hop fringes into the pop mainstream (thanks in large part to her angelic chorus turn on the inspirational anthem “Where Is the Love?”), her mischievous, sensuous energy utterly transformed the group into the pre-eminent party machine of the 2000s. Fergie didn’t just feature on some of the decade’s most ubiquitous bops, she practically changed the way we spoke: For a while there, it became impossible to utter the words “shut up” without mimicking Fergie’s incessant hook from the Peas single of the same name, while 2005’s heavy-breathing hit “My Humps” effectively replaced “booty” as rap’s posterior metaphor of choice. Inevitably, Fergie’s ample star power demanded a solo showcase, and her multi-platinum 2006 debut, <I>The Dutchess</I>, established her as a Madonna-esque pop polymath who could pull off raunchy Miami-bass throwbacks (“Fergalicious”) and heart-squeezing acoustic balladry (“Big Girls Don’t Cry”) with equal aplomb. After the Peas went on hiatus following 2010’s <I>The Beginning</I>, Fergie resurfaced in 2017 to both announce her departure from the group and drop her second solo effort, <I>Double Dutchess</I>, whose manic trap banger “M.I.L.F. $” raucously reintroduced a veteran artist ready to out-sass a new generation of rap divas.

Since then, the Barbados-born pop innovator has been making us beg for more. Starting with 2007's Good Girl Gone Bad, Rihanna has cleverly played with her image, incorporating BDSM allusions and sexual bravado, and expanding her reggae-tinged dance pop to encompass epic EDM, sultry rock, and undulating hip-hop. Even when she's working with larger-than-life foils—Eminem, Drake—Rihanna's still the one making demands.",

Since then, the Barbados-born pop innovator has been making us beg for more. Starting with 2007's Good Girl Gone Bad, Rihanna has cleverly played with her image, incorporating BDSM allusions and sexual bravado, and expanding her reggae-tinged dance pop to encompass epic EDM, sultry rock, and undulating hip-hop. Even when she's working with larger-than-life foils—Eminem, Drake—Rihanna's still the one making demands.",

                  "standard": "For the musical companion to <i>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</i>, readmission to Marvel’s African kingdom comes with the same magical elements of wonder and revelation found the first time around. This is perhaps in part down to the return of Ludwig Göransson—who composed the score for <i>Wakanda Forever</i> and its 2018 predecessor—who co-helms (alongside Archie Davis, Dave Jordan, and director Ryan Coogler) this new, brilliantly diverse run of original tracks. “For this movie and soundtrack especially, Ryan and I wanted to create a soundworld that's incredibly immersive, where you can't tell the difference from song and score,” Ludwig Göransson tells Apple Music. “So the only way to achieve that was for me to do both at the same time. So while I was recording musicians in the daytime in Mexico for the score, at night I was using those score elements and those recordings done earlier in the day, booking sessions in Mexico with contemporary artists, rappers, and singers.” \n\nA touching rendition of Bob Marley’s “No Woman, No Cry” from Nigerian singer Tems was the world’s first taste of the movie’s music, via a trailer at San Diego Comic-Con 2022, and helped prep us for the mournful tone of the sequel. Just as the world stopped to grieve the passing of actor Chadwick Boseman, so do the five tribes of Wakanda mark the death of the eponymous superhero. Marking this occasion with solo music for the first time in six years, Rihanna sings the Tems-penned elegy “Lift Me Up.” \"As soon as I read the script and started thinking about artists to work with, she was probably the first name on the list,” Göransson says. “Because this story is so much about powerful women and motherhood.”\n\nAfrica itself is also, of course, central to the soundtrack. Traditional flutes and drums combine for thrillingly fluid sections (Fireboy DML’s “Coming Back for You”), and the sweeping head rush of amapiano also appears on “Love & Loyalty” (by DBN Gogo, Sino Msolo, Kamo Mphela, Young Stunna, and Busiswa), recorded in Lagos, West Africa’s central music hub. Felt in the double-time rhymes of Rema and Alemán (“Pantera”) and an ethereal coming-together of newcomers CKay and PinkPantheress (“Anya Mmiri”) is the resilience of African and Mesoamerican cultures—glistening with tradition but thriving through bright reinvention. \n\n“It was really tough [at first] because we had a sound with themes and instruments from the first movie that I couldn't use again and all of those themes has so much meaning to it,” Göransson says. “So I think that was the most exciting part when we worked on this movie, was to create a completely unique, immersive sound experience where all the sound, all the music, all the songs, all the words, everything was written specifically. It's Mayan, it's Aztec, it's synthesizers, it's <i>songs</i>, it's regional Mexican songs, it's Afropop, it's rap. It's the whole plate!”\n",

                  "standard": "Rihanna spent the first decade of her career uniting pop, rap, R&B, and EDM audiences under her ever-expanding umbrella-ella-ella. But on her eighth album, 2016’s <i>ANTI</i>, Rihanna quit making music for the masses and started making music for herself. Though hardly the wanton act of commercial suicide its title might suggest, <i>ANTI</i> nonetheless presents a stark, intimate portrait of RiRi in the raw. Beats twitch and clang where they used to thump, minimalist incantations replace the soaring choruses of old, pop polish gives way to jagged edges, Calvin Harris collabs take a backseat to Tame Impala covers. With its gritty industrial-soot patina and lo-fi patchwork quality, the album is much closer in spirit to the insular indie R&B of left-field mavericks like Solange and Blood Orange than to anything pumping out of the Coachella dance tent.<br /> \nBut by stripping down the production, <i>ANTI</i> brings Rihanna’s most magnetic qualities to the fore, as she infuses the woozy, fever-dream boudoir soul of “Kiss It Better” with the righteous indignation of a woman scorned, while investing the sacred gospel sway of “Love on the Brain” with profane, unfiltered expressions of romantic longing. And on her rendition of Tame Impala’s “New Person, Same OId Mistakes”—essentially a new vocal recording atop the same backing track, rebranded as “Same Ol’ Mistakes”—she drowns herself in Kevin Parker’s psychedelic stew as if self-adminteristing a baptism, reframing the original’s sad-eyed ennui as ecstatic rebirth. Yet even a deliberately transgressive Rihanna record couldn’t help but find its way to the top of the charts: Her dancehall dalliance with Drake on “Work” yielded one of the decade’s most incessant earworms, while providing a ready-made mission statement for an artist intent on maintaining her rarefied pop-icon stature entirely on her own terms.",

Chris Brown turns up on “Nobody’s Business”: a defiant duet built over a Michael Jackson–flavored foundation where the two proclaim their love for each other despite their publicly turbulent relationship. Eminem returns for the euphoric “Numb.” Where “Nobody’s Business” flaunts her relationship with Brown to a judging audience, “Diamonds” sounds like a heartfelt serenade intended for his ears only. The deluxe version contains the piano ballad “Half of Me” and two remixes of “Diamonds.”"

Her violent altercation with boyfriend Chris Brown ignited a horrifying media circus, and there was intense speculation as to how she would use <i>Rated R</i> to address the turmoil in her personal life. A theme of lost love is evident in “Fire Bomb,” “Photographs” and “The Last Song,” while “Stupid In Love” contains a haunting reference to the Brown incident:  “Don’t understand it / Blood on your hands / And still you insist / On repeatedly trying / To tell me lies.”  Even the less personal songs have a brooding aura, exemplified by the terror and vulnerability of the lead single, “Russian Roulette.” The larger-than-life performances of “G4L” and “Rockstar 101” have more in common with Depeche Mode than Beyoncé. It’s exciting to hear Rihanna pushing into darker, more challenging territory, even as she retains the glamour of a futuristic diva. It would have been easy for a pop star of her stature to gloss over personal tribulation, but instead Rihanna confronts her pain head-on with the confessional “Cold Case Love.”"
